                        it should not be confused as the same company. I worked with the <strong>Rail Control and Solutions Team</strong> to manage train communications on the <strong>Wuhu and Cairo Monorails.</strong> \
                        Furthermore, I supported the development of the <strong>Train Management System</strong> which oversees all the signals on the train. Moreover, I implemented applications to track these signals \
                        and created automated regressions tests. BT has since been bought by Alstom. Let\'s hope this doesn\'t become a trend.'
