                        but should not be confused as the same company. I worked with the Rail Control and Solutions Team to manage train communications on the Wuhu and Cairo Monorails. \
                        I supported the development of the Train Management System which oversees all the signals on the train. I implemented applications to track these signals \
                        and created automated regressions tests. BT has since been bought by Alstom. Seems my former employers always get bought out. '
