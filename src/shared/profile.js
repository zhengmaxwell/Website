    description: 'I am a young man who to my parents dismay has not chosen to become a medical doctor. Instead, I aspire to make an impact \
                    without ever having to charge someone for a slip of paper with my signature detailing why so and so could not write their exam today due to their phantom illness. \
                    I am incredibly passionate about sustainability. I believe that issues about the environment, energy shortages, and waste mangement will be the big problem of this generation.\
                    Furthermore, I am deeply interested in the intersectionality between humankind and computers. Through my studies in robotics engineering, I am often met with challenges \
                    to make something more \"human-like"\ which has left me with the question: What makes us human? In a world so connected yet so divided at the same time it is easy to lose sight of our humanity. \
                    I strive to work towards the goal of global sustainability whilst seeking what it means to be human in an age of machines.',
